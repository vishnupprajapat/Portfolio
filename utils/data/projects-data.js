      "As a web developer, I spearheaded the creation of the Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Rajasthan Sanskrit University website using a diverse range of tools and technologies. Leveraging my expertise in front-end development, I utilized React JS as the core framework to ensure a dynamic and interactive user experience. Employing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I crafted a visually appealing and responsive design that caters to a wide range of devices and screen sizes.To manage state efficiently and maintain a robust architecture, I implemented Redux Toolkit, enabling seamless data flow throughout the application. Leveraging Axios, I facilitated smooth communication with the backend, ensuring efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.",
